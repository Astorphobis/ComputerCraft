#A-Ntivirus
Keep in mind, it's **unfinished!!** and now it only scans disk's startup file for any "startup" text inside - which will probably replace AV's startup after reboot.
You can use it to build a complex library of evil stuff =)
##How to install
Copy content of the "startup" file to the startup file in your CC Computer =)
##Unfinished stuff
Or better say things, that I wanted to add
- Bigger virus database
- Malicious SW database (scan for infinite loops - warn users before running, show them the CTRL + T command, if in combination with raw pullEvent, warn user that he might have to destroy the PC, offer him setting label of this PC)
- "checkforfile" command ("checkforfile install" will check if there are any viruses in the file "install")
