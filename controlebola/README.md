#controlebola
This is a very simple tool used to control PCs infected with "Ebola" Rootkit
##How to install
Copy contents of "controlebola" file to any CC Computer. The file name doesn't have to be "controlebola"
##Improvements **YOU** can do
- If you want to tune it, you can make it sending to a specific PC id instead of broadcasting.. or both modes =) and it can send two messages, first can be something like "controlebola" - the infected pc will notice this and receive second messgae, which will be the command. Right now, it'll start all broadcasted texts =D
